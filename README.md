Zshify is a minimalistic, one command installation to customize prompt of your Zshell (zsh)!

## Installation

Installation is done using the [`npx` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```zsh
npx zshify
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah that's it, no downloads, no hassle. A minimalistic installation for the minimalistic package.

## Why Zshify?

Aren't you tired of your default Zsh prompt looking like this? Cluttered, ugly and slow?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearing over and over again with the usual boring info? Like you really want to know your username over and over again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not change it to it's minimal version? And that too with colors!
