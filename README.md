Zshify is a minimalistic, one command installation to customize the prompt of your Zshell or Zsh!

## Installation

Installation is done using the [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally) command:

```zsh
bunx zshify
```

Alternatively, you can install using `bunx`.

Yeah that's it, no downloads, no hassle. A minimalistic installation for the minimalistic package.

## Why Zshify?

Aren't you tired of your default Zsh prompt looking like this? Cluttered, ugly and slow?

Why not change it to it's minimal version? And that too with colors!
