# Zshify - A Minimalistic Touch To Your Prompt!

Zshify is a minimalistic, open source package to customize prompt of your Z shell (zsh)!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren't you tired of default Zsh prompt appearing over and over again with the usual boring info? Like you really want to know your username over and over again.
