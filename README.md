<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrjdalal/zshify/master/zshify.png" width="480">

Zshify is a minimalistic, one command installation to customize the prompt of your Zshell or Zsh!

## Installation

Installation is done using the [`npx` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```zsh
npx zshify
```

Yeah that's it, no downloads, no hassle. A minimalistic installation for the minimalistic package.

## Why Zshify?

Aren't you tired of your default Zsh prompt looking like this? Cluttered, ugly and slow?

Appearing over and over again with the usual boring info? Like you really want to know your username over and over again.

Why not change it to it's minimal version? And that too with colors!
