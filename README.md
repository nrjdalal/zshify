<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrjdalal/zshify/master/zshify.png">

Zshify is a minimalistic, one command installation to customize the prompt of your Zshell or Zsh!

## Installation

Installation is done using the [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally) command:

```zsh
npx zshify
```

Alternatively, you can install using `/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://rdt.li/zshify)"` command.

Yeah that's it, no downloads, no hassle. A minimalistic installation for a minimalistic package.

> See advanced section to to enrich your terminal experience with autosuggestions, history search and syntax highlighting.

## Why Zshify?

- Aren't you tired of your default Zsh prompt looking like this? Cluttered, ugly and slow?
- Don't you need some additional features / useful aliases and functions are added as default.

Why not change it to it's minimal yet advanced version? And that too with colors!
